                    Dragon boat racing is one of the most popular sports in the world. 
                    Though the origin of the sport is in Asian countries, many Non-Asian 
                    countries are also taking interest in this sport. From a study report 
                    it has been found that in China, 250,000 people gather to enjoy the 
                    dragon boat racing every year. Out of which 50,000 people come to see 
                    from the practise time itself. This is not a race of individuals; 
                    rather it is teamwork where a large group of people generally between 
                    20 and 50 sail a boat by paddling. Similarly other teams also participate 
                    in the race. The team whose boat’s dragon nose touches the finishing line 
                    is declared as winner. Both men and women can participate in this sport.

                    Dragon Boat Racing originated in China and its history goes back more than 
                    2000 years. The first people to participate were superstitious Chinese 
                    villagers who celebrated the 5th day of the 5th lunar month of the Chinese 
                    calendar. Dragon boating was held to avert misfortune and encourage rains 
                    for prosperity. The main object of their worship was the dragon, hence the 
                    name ‘dragon boat racing’.

                    The story of dragon boats evolved over the years and it involved the famous 
                    poet Qu Yuan who threw himself in the Miluo River after being framed and realising 
                    that his motherland has been damaged. He felt so much upset and sorrow about 
                    his country that on lunar May fifth he ended his life. This tragic event transformed 
                    into a festival where people paddled boats to drive fishes away and fed the water 
                    creatures with Zongzi (Chinese rice dish wrapped in bamboo leaves) so that 
                    Qu Yuan’s body would not become their dinner.
