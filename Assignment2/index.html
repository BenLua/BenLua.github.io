                    Dragon boat racing is one of the most popular sports in the world. 
                    Though the origin of the sport is in Asian countries, many Non-Asian countries are also taking interest in this sport. 
                    From a study report it has been found that in China, 250,000 people gather to enjoy the dragon boat racing every year. 
                    Out of which 50,000 people come to see from the practise time itself.
                    This is not a race of individuals; 
                    rather it is teamwork where a large group of people generally between 20 and 50 sail a boat by paddling. 
                    Similarly other teams also participate in the race. The team whose boatâ€™s dragon nose touches the finishing line is declared as winner. 
                    Both men and women can participate in this sport.
